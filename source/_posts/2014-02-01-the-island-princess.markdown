We'll be in an interior room for 15 days, so we picked a location near a public deck. The bridge can be seen above us.

The promenade on the Island Princess wraps all of the way around the the ship with no stairs. It's also wide enough in some areas for full-sized loungers.

The crew direct passengers to the buffet upon boarding the ship on embarkation so we enjoyed a quiet lunch in the dining room.

The Island Princess had one of the larger libraries we've seen at sea.

It also had a large card room stocked with board games and puzzles. The amount of non-revenue generating space was much higher than the newer builds.

Most decks had a public aft balcony, rather than private staterooms. Behind us is the 17th Street Causeway Bridge which opens on a schedule every half an hour.

The main pool is still empty on the morning of our first sea day. It's still a little chilly as we leave Florida heading towards Aruba.
