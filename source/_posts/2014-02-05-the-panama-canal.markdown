Traveling through the canal took most of the day. We approchaed the Gatun Locks just before 9 AM. It consists of three chambers and lifts us 85 feet. The Coral Princess and a freighter were already in the locks as we line up.

Just before the Gatun Locks sit the doors for the new set of locks, awaiting installation. A new, wider canal is due to open soon.

The doors close behind us and a bridge lowers to allow traffic across the canal. It is one of the only ways to cross on the Atlantic side.

One of the eight mules, or electric locomotives, guiding us through the canal. With as little as two feet of clearance on each side of the ship, it takes considerable skill on the part of the operators.

Immediately after the first three locks is Gatun Lake. Ahead of us the Coral Princess is anchored for the day. We proceed through the lake towards the Pacific.

A freighter is next to us in the Pedro Miguel Locks as we approach the Pacific Ocean. Construction of the new canal can be seen in the background.

A double set of doors at the Miraflores locks provide additional protection. If a ship were to ram one set of doors, the entire contents of Gautun Lake would drain into the ocean, halting operation of the entire canal.

The Bridge of the Americas, behind us as we head towards Panama City. It took nearly eight hours to complete the transit.
