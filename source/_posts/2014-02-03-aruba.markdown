After two days at sea we arrived in Aruba. We booked a private ATV tour with [Kini Kini Tours](http://www.kinikinitours.com/).

Our first stop was the Alto Vista Chapel on the hills above the north shore.

The Baby Bridge isn't as impressive as the Natural Bridge, formed out of coral limestone, which collapsed in 2005.

The Bushiribana Ruins is the site of a former gold smelter built in 1825.

The Ayo Rock Formations were used by the earliest settlers on the island, the Arawak people, to listen for incoming thunderstorms. They carved petroglyphs in to some of the rocks.

The Natural Pool is formed by rock and volcanic stone circles, located on the remote east coast.
